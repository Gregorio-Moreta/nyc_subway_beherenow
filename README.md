# Intro to Django

So far we've learened how to make the back-end for web applications in Express with Node in JavaScript. It is similar to flask in python, both are relatively lightweight and require other libraries in order to have even basic functionality (such as Mongoose or PeeWee). 

Django is philosophically different in that it strives to be a full-featured *framework*, so it will include significantly more features and have much stronger "opinions" on how its code should be written. 

Neither philosophical approach (lightweight vs. full-featured) is intrinsically better than the other as both have advantages and disadvantages. You may find yourself prefering one way over the other.

Let's learn the core features of Django and how to build web apps "the Django way."

## Objectives

By the end of this, you should be able to:

* Discuss the core features of Django
* Create a Django application

## What is Django?

Created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, developers at the Lawrence Journal World Newspaper, Django was born out of frustrations the developers had working with PHP. Working for the publication, applications often had to be created very quickly, sometimes within a few hours, and Holovaty and Willison needed a tool to accomplish just that, while keeping the development process clean and maintainable. They wanted to move from PHP to building with Python, but none of the tools and technologies that were around at the time came with the features they wanted - things like CSS, well designed URLs, the way the request/response cycle would work, and deployment. 

Although the initial intention may not have been to create a new web framework, Django proved itself to be an extremely useful and dynamic tool, and the World Company (who owned the newspaper) agreed to open source it. And the rest is history!

Instagram is the largest Django application out there right now. When it was sold to Facebook, they had a total of 13 employees working on the app. Today, they have hundreds!


## Setting Up a Django Project

We're going to make a Django project called `nyc_subway` that will keep track of subway stations and lines!
We'll start by creating our project folder: `mkdir nyc_subway`. 


### Set Up & Manage Virtual Environment

We'll be using [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage our virtual environments. 

Create the virutal environment with `mkvirtualenv nyc_subway`.

We'll automatically enter the virtual envirnoment when we create it. Exit the environemnt with the `deactivate` command and re-enter with `workon nyc_subway`. If we're in the project's root directory and the root directory is `nyc_subway` all we will need to type is `workon .`.Running just the `workon` command will list all of our available environments and `rmvirtualenv environment_name` to delete one.


### Install Django
To install Django we'll run `pip install django`.

In order to manage our dependencies, we can run run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. The `pip freeze` command on its own will show what dependencies are installed (in this case, for our virtual environment). 

If someone wants to install the project's dependencies on another computer, they would create a virtual environemnt and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


### Using `django-admin` to create our Django Project

Django includes a `django-admin` command that we can use to quickly start a project template.

Run the command (including the `.` at the end): `django-admin startproject nyc_subway_beherenow . `. Your directory should look like this:
```
.
├── nyc_subway
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```

It should *not* look like this:
```
.
├── nyc_subway
│   ├── nyc_subway
│   │   ├── asgi.py
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── settings.py
│   │   ├── urls.py
│   │   └── wsgi.py
│   └── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```

If it looks like the second example, you ran the command wrong. Make sure you ran `django-admin startproject nyc_subway . ` with the `.` at the end. Delete the directory and start over. Also make sure you've run the `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command after!


#### Start the Server

Our Django project has create a file called `manage.py`! The `manage.py` script contains a lot of management commands for Django. You can see a list of the commands `manage.py` offers by typing `python manage.py`.

We can run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server. We can run this right now to check that our project runs without errors. For now it will load a nice homepage and not do much else.


### Setting Up Postgresql

By default Django uses SQLite. We'll be using Postgresql instead. Make sure that our database is up and running with `brew services list`, then run the following SQL script:


```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE nyc_subway;

-- Create an admin user for our app to use
CREATE USER nyc_subway_admin WITH PASSWORD 'password';

-- Give that user permissins to manage the database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nyc_subway TO nyc_subway_beherenow_admin;
```

Next, install our Postgres adaptor: `pip install psycopg2-binary`.

Update our project requirements with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

Edit the `nyc_subway/stettings.py` file to include the database configuration:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'nyc_subway_beherenow',
        'USER': 'nyc_subway_beherenow_admin',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'localhost'
    }
}


Run `python manage.py runserver` to confirm our Django project connects to our database without errors.


### Using `django-admin` to create our Django App

A Django *project* is composed of many *apps*. Our `nyc_subway` project directory is the base of the Django project where we'll handle our base routes, project-level configurations and include our apps. We'll make a `subway` app where we will write our models.

Per the Django documentation...
> What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something – e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

Create the app with `django-admin startapp subway`. (Note there's no `.` at the end this time). 

Then, update `nyc_subway/settings.py` to include `'subway'` in the list of `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'subway'
]
```

Directory:
```
.
├── nyc_subway
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── subway
│   ├── migrations
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```


### Running Our First Migration

If you look at the list of `INSTALLED_APPS` you can see that there are automatically some pre-made Django apps that include user-based authentication. In order for our application to run we need to have a `user` table and more in our database. In order to update our database we'll run a *migration*.

#### Create & run migrations:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Use `psql` to look at your `nyc_subway` database. What tables have been added?

Whenever we make changes to our Django application that will require changes to the database (such as new tables or column changes) we will need to create and run a migration. 

If we want to see what a migration's SQL code will look like we can run `python manage.py sqlmigrate subway 0001`.

### Creating Our First Model

First, let's plan our models using an UML diagram.

We'll have three models:
 - Subway Trains
 - Subway Lines
 - Subway Stations

What are the relationships between the trains, lines and stations?

Our train models will have the following fields:
  - Model
  - Car Count
  - Line

Our line models will have the following:
  - Name
  - Color
  - Stations

Our stations will have the following:
  - Name
  - Lines

![UML Diagram](/uml.svg)

```python
# subway/models.py
class Station(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=120)

  def __str__(self):
    return self.name

class Line(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=4)
  hex_color = models.CharField(max_length=6)
  stations = models.ManyToManyField(Station)

  def __str__(self):
    return self.name

class Train(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=5)
  cbtc_enabled = models.BooleanField()
  line = models.ForeignKey(Line, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='trains')

  def __str__(self):
    return self.name
```

## The Admin Panel (where the magic happens)

We're going to make our first user that can log into our website: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

Call the user "admin", the email is optional and you can ignore the password warnings.

Next, we're going to add our models to the admin panel. Update `subway/admin.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Train, Line, Station

admin.site.register(Station)
admin.site.register(Line)
admin.site.register(Train)
```

Next, go to `http://localhost:8000/admin` and log in. Magic!

## Doanload PSQL
You should just be able to do it through homebrew on mac, here is the command:
- https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/postgresql@14
- https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew
```
brew install postgresql@14
```

## Launch postgreSQL 
If you have trouble signing into the psql shell checkout the thread 
- https://chat.openai.com/share/d56a542d-5eee-490c-a981-a9efe272875a
```
psql postgres
```
check user you are signed in with 
```
SELECT current_user;
```

quit psql
```
\q
or
exit
```
and sign back in using this command
```
psql -U nyc_subway_beherenow_admin -d nyc_subway_beherenow
```
Grant priviliges
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nyc_subway_beherenow TO nyc_subway_beherenow_admin;
```
connect to your database 
```
\c nyc_subway_beherenow
```

You may also need to check your postgreSQL server and potentially restart it if there are problems 
```
brew services list
```
```
brew services restart postgresql@14
```

## Creating tables in the database
The order that you create these matters because of the relationships between the models.

Notice that the subway_station table doesn not have any primary keys in it, so it's the first able we want to create since it doesn't rely on any other table to exist.

If we try to create subway_line, subway_train, or subway_line_station tables, it would produce an error because they rely on each other through their fields.

- Make sure you are in your psql shell, logged in as the correct user, and connected to your database. Some users can grant privileges and others cannot, so keep that in mind

```
CREATE TABLE subway_station (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE subway_line (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                                                                                              
  name VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  hex_color VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE subway_train (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  cbtc_enabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  line_id INT REFERENCES subway_line(id)
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE subway_line_stations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  line_id INT REFERENCES subway_line(id),
  station_id INT REFERENCES subway_station(id),
  CONSTRAINT unique_line_station_pair UNIQUE (line_id, station_id)
);
```
## Creating entries PSQL shell
These are a few commands you can use to create a few entries, if you want more data to play around with I suggest asking chatgpt to generate it for you for the time being.

Input your entries in the given order to avoid any errors.

Station
```
INSERT INTO subway_station (name) 
VALUES ('Station 1'), ('Station 2'), ('Station 3'), ('Station 4'), ('Station 5');
```
Line
```
INSERT INTO subway_line (name, hex_color) 
VALUES ('Line 1', 'FF0000'), ('Line 2', '00FF00'), ('Line 3', '0000FF'), ('Line 4', 'FFFF00'), ('Line 5', '00FFFF');
```
Train
```
INSERT INTO subway_train (name, cbtc_enabled, line_id) 
VALUES ('Train 1', true, 1), ('Train 2', false, 1), ('Train 3', true, 2), ('Train 4', false, 2), ('Train 5', true, 3);
```

## Granting Permissions
You may need to grant further permissions on these new tables you generated. If you don't there may be an error stopping you from creating items in your database.

In this case our user would be 
```
nyc_subway_admin
```
You can grant permissions to a table with the following commands. 
```
 GRANT SELECT ON TABLE subway_station TO nyc_subway_admin;
```
```
 GRANT SELECT ON TABLE subway_line TO nyc_subway_admin;
```
```
 GRANT SELECT ON TABLE subway_train TO nyc_subway_admin;
```

## Permissions I had to set for Ipython shell to function

Grant table permissions: If the user doesn't have the necessary permissions, you can grant them explicitly. You can use the appropriate SQL command to grant the required privileges (such as INSERT) on the "subway_station" table to the user. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can execute the following command as a database superuser:

```
GRANT INSERT ON TABLE subway_station TO nyc_subway_beherenow_admin;
```

Grant sequence permissions: If the user doesn't have the necessary permissions, you can grant them explicitly. You can use the appropriate SQL command to grant the required privileges (such as USAGE or USAGE, SELECT, UPDATE) on the sequence to the user. The specific command may vary depending on the database management system you are using. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can execute the following command as a database superuser:

If you get this error
ProgrammingError: permission denied for sequence subway_station_id_seq
```
GRANT USAGE, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE ON SEQUENCE subway_station_id_seq TO nyc_subway_beherenow_admin;
```

If you get back this error
ProgrammingError: permission denied for table subway_station
```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE subway_station TO nyc_subway_beherenow_admin;
```

If you get back this error
ProgrammingError: permission denied for table subway_line_stations
```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLE subway_line_stations TO nyc_subway_beherenow_admin;
```

If all else fails just drop your error in chatgpt and try those granting permission commands it gives you for example:

```
ProgrammingError: permission denied for table subway_line_stations
```

## Summary
So far we have a functional CRUD app with basic functionality, all of it from django itself.
There is a more complete way of doing the same except with djangorestframework. It's just a framework build on top of django which gives a lot of useful tools out of the gate.

Checkout the djangorestframework tutorial repo I put together here:
- https://github.com/Gregorio-Moreta/djangorestframework-tutorial/tree/Part-6/6-viewsets-routers

## Django's ORM

We'll install `shell_plus` to have a CLI for our Django app with `pip install django-extensions`.
Also, update your `INSTALLED_APPS` to include `django_extensions`.
Next, we'll install `ipython` as a dependency of our project with `pip install ipython`.

Make sure you are in your virtual environment for these commands and to run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`!

Now you can use `ipython` as your shell with `python manage.py shell_plus --ipython`.

You can use this to run SQL commands from the python shell instead of going into psql shell directly.

### Making Queries
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/queries/

```python
# Select all of the Train objects in the database
Train.objects.all()

# Select All Objects and Print All Values
Train.objects.all().values_list()

# Select All Objects and Print Specific Value
Train.objects.all().values_list('name')

# Get the Train with the id of 1 (can also do pk here which stands for primary key)
Train.objects.get(id=1)

# Get the Train with the name "Train 1", if there are two Train 1's this will error!
Train.objects.get(name="Train 1")

# Get all the Train who are or are not cbtc_enabled with a value of 'f' or 't'
Train.objects.filter(cbtc_enabled="f")

# Store an Train in a variable for later access:
t = Train.objects.get(name="Train 5")


# Have to modify these to make them function for our usecase.

# Now you can look up the artist's songs:
# AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'all'
# We would need some field that could accept the all method called on it, a list maybe
t.name.all()
t.name.all().values_list()

# Create an Train with the following attributes, then save, commiting it to the database
# Train9000 = Train(name="Train 9000", cbtc_enabled="t", line_id="999")
Train9000 = Station(name="Train 9000")
Train9000.save()

# Oops, we misspelled Train9000's name! Let's change it and then commit to the DB
Train9000.name = "Train9000Train9000Train9000Train9000"
Train9000.save()

# Let's add an album to the artist
album = Station(name="DELETE THIS ALBUM ! ! ! !, DELETE THIS ALBUM ! ! ! !, ")
album.save()

# Delete the Station
album.delete()
```

These are some simple ones, but if you like Django, know that you can do some
really cool things with it's ORM. For example:

```python
# This will return all Trains who's name starts with an A
Train.objects.filter(name__startswith="A")

# This will return all the Trains with the id's 1 and 2, excluding all those equal to or greater than 3
Train.objects.exclude(line_id__gte=3)
```
